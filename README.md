# Hyperbuild

Hyperbuild is the build system for Phosphorus Five that allows you to
reproduce and backup your Phosphorus Five installation.
This is done by taking the existing system's state, whatever that is, minus any data, users, passwords, settings, etc -
And create a binary release of the system. It also allows you to create your own custom build,
containing whatever modules you want to distribute in your core.
