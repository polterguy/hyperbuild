# Hyperbuild, Phosphorus Five's build system

This is the build system for Phosphorus Five, which allows you to reproduce your Phosphorus Five
installation, in any ways you see fit, and create a binary release of the system. This is done
by taking the existing system's state, whatever that is, minus any data, users, passwords, settings, etc -
And create a binary release of the system, allowing you to cryptographically sign modules, choose
which modules are to be in the main distribution, etc, etc, etc.

If you have created your own modules, or changed existing modules, Hyperbuild will allow you to create
a binary release of your system, according to whatever changes you have applied to your original system.
