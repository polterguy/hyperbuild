## Hyperbuild, replicating your system

Hyperbuild allows you to easily backup or replicate your system. It doesn't create a backup of your data,
but you can configure it to replicate either individual modules, or your system as a whole, or parts of your
system. Below is a screenshot.

At the top of Hyperbuild, you can choose to package a single module, and download it to your client
as a zip file. At the bottom of it, you can choose to create a _"main distro"_, which will contain the
Phosphorus Five core, in addition to all modules you choose to include. There's not really much to say
about Hyperbuild, since it should be fairly obvious what it does. However, it may be wise to use it
every now and then, to create a backup of your server's code, in case you for some reasons are infected
with malicious code - At which point you can _"rollback"_ your server to a previous version.
